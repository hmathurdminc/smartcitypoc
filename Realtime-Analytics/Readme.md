**Use Case 2: Develop real-time visualizations and dashboards based on events produced by IoT devices such as weather sensors, traffic signals etc. to analyze and improve security, safety and well-being of Denver citizens.**
To build stream analytics models, DMI used a custom simulator to simulate the data that is required for the real-time analytics. Leveraging this sample datasets, we built Azure Stream Analytics queries  analyze weather patterns and traffic congestion in a specific neighborhood within a particular timeframe. In order to build the Stream Analytics components, we leveraged Azure IoT hub, Azure Stream Analytics, and Power BI. Exhibit 26 illustrates the proposal technical design.
